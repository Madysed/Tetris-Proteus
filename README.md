# 🎮 Tetris – Proteus Simulation Project

This project implements the classic **Tetris game** using **Proteus Design Suite**.  
The game runs in a fully simulated hardware environment and demonstrates real-time embedded system behavior.

It includes:

- 🧱 Real-time block movement  
- 🔄 Block rotation  
- 🚧 Collision detection  
- 🗑️ Line clearing logic  
- 🏆 Score management  

All hardware components such as the display and input buttons are simulated directly inside Proteus.
